The complexity of plots you can make in Matplotlib range from simple scatter plots to interactive 3d plots.

You could make a model to describe something, whether that be a class of objects, like cats, or the relationship between multiple things, like mass, acceleration and force in Newton's Second Law. Once you have a model, you might want to use it to make predictions. As an example, maybe you'd like to be able to make a good guess for someone's weight based on their height – you could make a model that describes the relationship between weight and height and use that model to predict weights.\n",

Just because you can make a model describing the relationship between two variables, and even if you can use this model to predict the value of one variable based on the value of the other, it doesn't mean that one causes the other. You may have heard this before as the difference between **correlation** and **causation**. A classic example is the relationship between ice cream sales and murder rates. Turns out, when ice cream sales rise, so do murder rates. Does this mean ice cream *causes* people to commit murder? Or get murdered? Nope!\n",
