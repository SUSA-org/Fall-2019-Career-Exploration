    "# Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='motivation'></a>\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Linear algebra is the study of vector spaces, and it encompasses linear equations and functions represented by vector spaces and matrices. Vectors and matrices are essential for storing data, which is why we often use Python packages such as Numpy and Pandas. A common problem is linear regression, which we will delve into solving using matrices and linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='notation'></a>\n",
    "## Notation\n",
    "Common notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{A}$: Bold capital letters represent matrices\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{x}$: Bold lowercase letters represent vectors\n",
    "* $\\theta$: Non-bold values represent scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='terminology'></a>\n",
    "## Matrix Terminology\n",
    "* **Dimension** or **size** of a matrix: A matrix is called an $m\\times n$ matrix if it has $m$ rows and $n$ columns.\n",
    "* **Identity** matrix: A square matrix with diagonal elements equal to $1$ and all off diagonal elements equal to zero. A $n\\times n$ identity matrix is often denoted as $I$ or $I_n$.\n",
    "* **Order or Size** of matrix: If a matrix has m rows and n columns, the order of the matrix is $m\\times n$. We denote the set of (real-valued) matrices $\\mathbb{M}_{m,n}$\n",
    "* **Transpose** of a matrix: The transpose of matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ satisfies the condition $\\mathbf{A_{j,i}} = \\mathbf{A_{i,j}}^T$. That is, the first row of $\\mathbf{A}$ is the first column of $\\mathbf{A}^T$.\n",
    "* **Square** matrix: A matrix with the same number of rows as columns. This matrix is in the shape of a square.\n",
    "* **Diagonal** matrix: A matrix with all the non-diagonal elements equal to $0$ is called a diagonal matrix.\n",
    "* **Scalar** matrix: A square matrix with all the diagonal elements equal to a constant.\n",
    "* **Column** matrix: A matrix which consists of exactly $1$ column. If it has $m$ rows, it can be treated as a $m\\times 1$ vector. \n",
    "* **Row** matrix: A matrix which consists of exactly $1$ column. If it has $m$ rows, it can be treated as a $m\\times 1$ vector. \n",

    "<a id='operation'></a>\n",
    "## Matrix Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='transpose'></a>\n",
    "### Transpose\n",
    "Transpose converts row vectors into column vectors, and vice versa. For example, for a $3 \\times 2$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ where $$ \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4\\\\ 7 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 1\\end{bmatrix}, \\mathbf{A}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 7 & 3\\\\ 4 & 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $$(\\mathbf{A}^T)^T = \\mathbf{A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='addsub'></a>\n",
    "### Addition & Subtraction\n",
    "if $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are both $m \\times n$, we form $\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}$ by adding corresponding entries. $$\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2\\\\ a_3 & a_4 \\end{bmatrix}, \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 & b_2\\\\ b_3 & b_4 \\end{bmatrix}, \\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1+b_1 & a_2+b_2\\\\ a_3+b_3 & a_4+b_4 \\end{bmatrix}$$ A fact about matrix addition and transpose is that $(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B})^T = \\mathbf{A}^T + \\mathbf{B}^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can perform subtraction in the same way, where we form $\\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{B}$ by subtracting entries of $\\mathbf{B}$ from corresponding entries of $\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can only perform matrix addition and subtraction when both matrices in the operation have the same dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='scalar_mul'></a>\n",
    "### Scalar Multiplication\n",
    "We can multiply a scalar (a.k.a. number) by a matrix by multiplying every entry of the matrix by the scalar. This is denoted $\\cdot$ between the scalar and the matrix. $$c \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2\\\\ a_3 & a_4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} c\\times a_1 & c\\times a_2\\\\ c\\times a_3 & c\\times a_4 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='matrix_mul'></a>\n",
    "### Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "If $\\mathbf{A}$ is $m \\times p$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ is $p \\times n$, we can form $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}$, which has dimension $m \\times n$. For matrix multiplication to occur, the number of columns of $\\mathbf{A}$ has to equal the number of rows of $\\mathbf{B}$. A fact about matrix multiplication and transpose is that $(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})^T = \\mathbf{B}^T\\mathbf{A}^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For matrix multiplication, in general we don't have $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A}$."

    "<a id='linear_independence'></a>\n",
    "## Linear Independence\n",
    "What does it mean for a set of vectors to be **linearly independent**? It is easier to define what it means to be linearly dependent. A set of vectors $$\\mathbf{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}$$ is linearly dependent if there exist scalars ${\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_n}$, not all equal to 0 such that $$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_ix_i = 0.$$\n",
    "In words, this means that there exists at least one vector that can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='invert'></a>\n",
    "## Invertibility\n",
    "The inverse of an $n\\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, denoted as $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$, satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A A}^{-1} = I_{n\\times n},\\ \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{A}=I_{n\\times n}.$$\n",
    "We may consider a concrete example with a $2\\times 2$ matrix. \n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b\\\\ c & d\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A}^{-1} = (\\det \\mathbf{A})^{-1}\\begin{bmatrix} d & -b\\\\ -c & a\\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{ad-bc} \\begin{bmatrix} d & -b\\\\ -c & a\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For inverting matrices of higher dimensions, the calculation is much more difficult. We will often want to use a computer to compute these for us. But why do we care about inverse matrices in the first place? Why do they come up in linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to this will show up toward the end of this lecture when we consider the normal equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember for later: If a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, so is its transpose, and the inverse of $\\mathbf{A}^T$ is the transpose of the inverse of $\\mathbf{A}$."

You could make a model to describe something, whether that be a class of objects, like cats, or the relationship between multiple things, like mass, acceleration and force in Newton's Second Law. Once you have a model, you might want to use it to make predictions. As an example, maybe you'd like to be able to make a good guess for someone's weight based on their height – you could make a model that describes the relationship between weight and height and use that model to predict weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one thing you should always keep in mind! Just because you can make a model describing the relationship between two variables, and even if you can use this model to predict the value of one variable based on the value of the other, it doesn't mean that one causes the other. You may have heard this before as the difference between **correlation** and **causation**. A classic example is the relationship between ice cream sales and murder rates. Turns out, when ice cream sales rise, so do murder rates. Does this mean ice cream *causes* people to commit murder? Or get murdered? Nope!\n",
