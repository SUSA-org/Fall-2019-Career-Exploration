    "# Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='motivation'></a>\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Linear algebra is the study of vector spaces, and it encompasses linear equations and functions represented by vector spaces and matrices. Vectors and matrices are essential for storing data, which is why we often use Python packages such as Numpy and Pandas. A common problem is linear regression, which we will delve into solving using matrices and linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='notation'></a>\n",
    "## Notation\n",
    "Common notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{A}$: Bold capital letters represent matrices\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{x}$: Bold lowercase letters represent vectors\n",
    "* $\\theta$: Non-bold values represent scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='terminology'></a>\n",
    "## Matrix Terminology\n",
    "* **Dimension** or **size** of a matrix: A matrix is called an $m\\times n$ matrix if it has $m$ rows and $n$ columns.\n",
    "* **Identity** matrix: A square matrix with diagonal elements equal to $1$ and all off diagonal elements equal to zero. A $n\\times n$ identity matrix is often denoted as $I$ or $I_n$.\n",
    "* **Order or Size** of matrix: If a matrix has m rows and n columns, the order of the matrix is $m\\times n$. We denote the set of (real-valued) matrices $\\mathbb{M}_{m,n}$\n",
    "* **Transpose** of a matrix: The transpose of matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ satisfies the condition $\\mathbf{A_{j,i}} = \\mathbf{A_{i,j}}^T$. That is, the first row of $\\mathbf{A}$ is the first column of $\\mathbf{A}^T$.\n",
    "* **Square** matrix: A matrix with the same number of rows as columns. This matrix is in the shape of a square.\n",
    "* **Diagonal** matrix: A matrix with all the non-diagonal elements equal to $0$ is called a diagonal matrix.\n",
    "* **Scalar** matrix: A square matrix with all the diagonal elements equal to a constant.\n",
    "* **Column** matrix: A matrix which consists of exactly $1$ column. If it has $m$ rows, it can be treated as a $m\\times 1$ vector. \n",
    "* **Row** matrix: A matrix which consists of exactly $1$ column. If it has $m$ rows, it can be treated as a $m\\times 1$ vector. \n",

    "## Matrix Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='transpose'></a>\n",
    "### Transpose\n",
    "Transpose converts row vectors into column vectors, and vice versa. For example, for a $3 \\times 2$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ where $$ \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4\\\\ 7 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 1\\end{bmatrix}, \\mathbf{A}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 7 & 3\\\\ 4 & 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $$(\\mathbf{A}^T)^T = \\mathbf{A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='addsub'></a>\n",
    "### Addition & Subtraction\n",
    "if $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are both $m \\times n$, we form $\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}$ by adding corresponding entries. $$\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2\\\\ a_3 & a_4 \\end{bmatrix}, \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 & b_2\\\\ b_3 & b_4 \\end{bmatrix}, \\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1+b_1 & a_2+b_2\\\\ a_3+b_3 & a_4+b_4 \\end{bmatrix}$$ A fact about matrix addition and transpose is that $(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B})^T = \\mathbf{A}^T + \\mathbf{B}^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can perform subtraction in the same way, where we form $\\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{B}$ by subtracting entries of $\\mathbf{B}$ from corresponding entries of $\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can only perform matrix addition and subtraction when both matrices in the operation have the same dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='scalar_mul'></a>\n",
    "### Scalar Multiplication\n",
    "We can multiply a scalar (a.k.a. number) by a matrix by multiplying every entry of the matrix by the scalar. This is denoted $\\cdot$ between the scalar and the matrix. $$c \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2\\\\ a_3 & a_4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} c\\times a_1 & c\\times a_2\\\\ c\\times a_3 & c\\times a_4 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='matrix_mul'></a>\n",
    "### Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "If $\\mathbf{A}$ is $m \\times p$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ is $p \\times n$, we can form $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}$, which has dimension $m \\times n$. For matrix multiplication to occur, the number of columns of $\\mathbf{A}$ has to equal the number of rows of $\\mathbf{B}$. A fact about matrix multiplication and transpose is that $(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})^T = \\mathbf{B}^T\\mathbf{A}^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For matrix multiplication, in general we don't have $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A}$."

    "<a id='linear_independence'></a>\n",
    "## Linear Independence\n",
    "What does it mean for a set of vectors to be **linearly independent**? It is easier to define what it means to be linearly dependent. A set of vectors $$\\mathbf{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}$$ is linearly dependent if there exist scalars ${\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_n}$, not all equal to 0 such that $$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_ix_i = 0.$$\n",
    "In words, this means that there exists at least one vector that can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='invert'></a>\n",
    "## Invertibility\n",
    "The inverse of an $n\\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, denoted as $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$, satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A A}^{-1} = I_{n\\times n},\\ \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{A}=I_{n\\times n}.$$\n",
    "We may consider a concrete example with a $2\\times 2$ matrix. \n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b\\\\ c & d\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{A}^{-1} = (\\det \\mathbf{A})^{-1}\\begin{bmatrix} d & -b\\\\ -c & a\\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{ad-bc} \\begin{bmatrix} d & -b\\\\ -c & a\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For inverting matrices of higher dimensions, the calculation is much more difficult. We will often want to use a computer to compute these for us. But why do we care about inverse matrices in the first place? Why do they come up in linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to this will show up toward the end of this lecture when we consider the normal equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember for later: If a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, so is its transpose, and the inverse of $\\mathbf{A}^T$ is the transpose of the inverse of $\\mathbf{A}$."

You can make a model as an attempt to describe the relationship between many related things, such as the year a computer was made as well as how much memory it can hold. With enough data, you can begin to make predictions such as how much memory a computer may hold in 5 years (hence, the create of [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to keep in mind what you are analyzing. Just because you can make a model describing the relationship between two variables, and even if you can use this model to predict the value of one variable based on the value of the other, it doesn't mean that one causes the other. You may have heard this before as the difference between **correlation** and **causation**. A classic example is the relationship between ice cream sales and murder rates. Turns out, when ice cream sales rise, so do murder rates. Does this mean ice cream *causes* people to commit murder? Or get murdered? Nope!\n",

    "You're probably thinking \"COOL! This looks like a pretty good representation of the data! But what do these coefficients even mean?\" That is a great question! As you might have guessed, the `intercept` term is where our line intersects with the y-axis, or when our predictor variable has a value of 0. In relation to our model, it's our prediction for `mpg` given a predictor variable value of 0. The `slope` term is a little more complicated. Yes, it is the slope of the line, but how do we interpret it in the relationship between `mpg` and our explanator?"

    "Another question you might have is, how do we know how good our model is? One way of measuring how well your model fits the data is the $R^2$ coefficient, or the **coefficient of determination**. Basically, what the $R^2$ represents is how much can our data vary but still be predicted accurately by the explanatory variable. If you want to look into the mathematical definition of $R^2$, you can check out the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination)."

If you see interesting patterns in your residual plot, it's indicative of some *bias* in your model – your error isn't due to randomness in the data but because of an underlying problem in the way you've defined the relationship between your variables. \n",

    "As you can see, the residuals aren't scattered randomly around the y-axis. The points are more spread out vertically for smaller values of `displacement` and less scattered vertically for larger values. Furthermore, in the middle the residuals are mostly above the line, while on the left and right side, the residuals tend to be below the line. Such a pattern as this one suggests that our model isn't that great at describing the relationship between `displacement` and `mpg`, and there's some fundamental issue with the assumption that the relationship can be modeled by a simple linear relationship. [Here](http://docs.statwing.com/interpreting-residual-plots-to-improve-your-regression/)'s some more information about how to interpret different patterns in residual plots and how you can change your model to fix these errors."

    "A **Q-Q plot** (quantile-quantile plot) is a scatterplot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another. If both sets of quantiles came from the same distribution, we should see the points forming a line that’s roughly straight. Here’s an example of a Normal Q-Q plot when both sets of quantiles truly come from standard normal distributions."

    "You'll notice that the model is no longer a line – it's a plane. This is the 3D analog to a line. Just as a line defines one value for $y$ for any given $x$, a plane defines one value for $z$ for any pair of $(x, y)$."
