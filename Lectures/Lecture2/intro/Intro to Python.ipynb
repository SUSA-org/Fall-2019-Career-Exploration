    "Python is a widely used programming language, and it's one of the easiest to learn because of how similar it is to [psuedocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) - basically, it looks really similar to regular English, so it can be easier to pick up and understand for people who are new to programming!\n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn't mean you should underestimate the power of Python! Despite being \"simple\", it's used for a wide array of computational tasks, including backend web development, image processing, and data analysis (which is what we will focus on this semester).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of how popular it is, there's also a large community of Python developers that work on 3rd-party Python packages to simplify a lot of tasks. Many of these are open-source projects, which means you can look at the code directly and even contribute to it (if you want). This also means that a lot of the more popular packages have been thoroughly tested for bugs and fixed by thousands (millions?) of people. You can browse some of these packages at the [Python Packge Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org), and we'll be using a lot of these packages throughout this semester."
