    "An introduction to your best friend in the realm of data science. Numpy is an optimized math library for Python. The code is vectorized as much as possible, which means that there's a heavy focus on using arrays (treated as n-dimensional vectors) to do operations. This is a shift away from doing looped operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "If you wanted to compute the dot product of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` = `[1*5, 2*4, 3*3, 4*2, 5*1]`, you could either loop through two **lists** in Python\n",
