    "\n",
    "For this project, you will be using the tools that you have learned so far on a real data science problem. You will be cleaning and analyzing a dataset to answer a research question, something that you will be doing for your entire career if you continue down this path.\n",

    "When you first start working with a dataset, it is often a good idea to just play around with the data to get an idea of what you're working with. This can help you make decisions about which parts of your data may be more useful than others, and also give us a basis for sanity checks later on when our code becomes more complicated. For example, in the the wines dataset we may see that the \"quality\" feature only ranges from 3 to 8, so if our model predicts a quality of 73 then we know there's something wrong!"

In order to avoid this kind of problem, pandas has other functions that let you look at your data from a broader perspective.
